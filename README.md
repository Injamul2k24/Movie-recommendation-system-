<h1>Movie Recommendation System</h1>
<p>This project is a Movie Recommendation System built using Python, Numpy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, and Matplotlib. The system leverages machine learning techniques to suggest movies based on the user's preferences. The front-end interface is developed using the Streamlit library, providing an interactive and user-friendly experience.

<h3>Features</h3>
<p><h4>Content-Based Filtering:</h4> Recommends movies similar to the ones a user likes based on movie metadata.</p>
<p><h4>Data Handling: </h4>Efficiently processes and analyzes large datasets using Pandas.</p>
<p><h4>Vectorization: </h4>Utilizes the CountVectorizer from Scikit-learn to convert movie descriptions into vectors for similarity calculations.</p>
<p><h4></h4></p>
<p><h4>Similarity Calculation:</h4>Employs cosine similarity to find movies that are most similar to the user's selected movie.</p>
<p><h4> Visualization:</h4>Matplotlib is used for visual representations of data and recommendations.</p>
<p><h4>Interactive UI:</h4>A clean and intuitive user interface powered by Streamlit, allowing users to search for movies and get instant recommendations.</p>
